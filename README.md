In this project, we focused on one of the past machine learning competitions from Kaggle â€“ Dogs vs Cats, whose goal is to design a state-of-the-art algorithm to distinguish dogs from cats. Based on the requirement, we implemented both the traditional CNN network and advanced techniques like transfer learning in pre-trained models like VGG16 to solve the classification problem. The final results demonstrated the excellent performance and superiority of transfer learning and we also brought forward some available ideas for further improvements on this binary classification task.
